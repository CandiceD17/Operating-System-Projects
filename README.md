# Operating System Projects

This is a codebase for C-implementation of OS projects in UCLA CS111 course. (I got all full scores for the projects.)

Some important concepts include:

- Accessing kernel mode and write kernel modules
- Implementing the pipe operator with file descriptors and system calls
- Round Robin scheduling algorithm
- Creating Mutex lock for safe writing and reading
- Implementing the entire ext2 file system from scratch
